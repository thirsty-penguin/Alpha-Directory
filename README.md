# Alpha-Directory

Alpha Directory allows admins to manage, search and store user information. 

Usage:
- All files need to be in the same directory
- The program requires the "userdb_file.txt" to function
  > If this file does not exist (or is empty) you can run "fixDB.py" and create one user and the neccessary file. 

Notes:
