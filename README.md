# Alpha-Directory

Alpha Directory allows admins to manage, search and store user information. 

Usage:
- All files need to be in the same directory
- The program requires the "userdb_file.txt" to function
  > If this file does not exist (or is empty) you can run "fixDB.py" and create one user and the neccessary file. 

Notes:

TO DO: 
- consolidate delete function somehow
- delete function loops an extra time for some reason
- if app not closed properly DB will not be pickle, need fix this
- Handle issue if userdb_file.txt is deleted/empty program will not run

NEEDED FEATURES:
- show users from within deletion function (done but needs refining)
- Search by first/last name
- Exit funtion to be able to exit entire program from any where
- when exiting from search function, needs to go to main menu and not try to quit the program
